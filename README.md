# Text-file-encryption-and-decryption
Program to encrypt or decrypt a text file by passing it as a system argument and if not the pgm will just encrypt or decryt what you type

Main program: encryption
In terminal type: python encryption.py path_of_my_text_file.txt 8 e
This is to encrypt your text file with a key equal to 8 (you can choose any key as long as it's a natural number). Write d for decrypt.
Finally, if no argument is given you can still run the pgm and encrypt or decrypt the text you type.
